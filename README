Every blog on LiveJournal has its own RSS feed. LiveJournal users who are not
friends of the blogger, can read through RSS only public entries in his blog.
Closed blog entries are available only to authenticated the author's friends.

The good news is that LiveJournal supports digest-authentication 
to be able to read both open and closed entries via RSS.

But the bad news is that Google Reader, which I use to read RSS 
feeds, does not support this method of authentication, and I have to go to 
LiveJournal and read my friends page through a web interface.

However, there is a good site http://freemyfeed.com, which understands this 
method of authentication and serves as an intermediary, giving the user 
RSS-feed with all entries.

So I wrote a script that receives from the LiveJournal 
(thank David Lynch for his excellent library lj.py) list of your
mutual friends and using your account in LJ for FreeMyFeed generate OPML-file
containing RSS feeds that do not require authorization.

Unfortunately, there is another problem. In LJ there are closed blog entries 
of two types:
    
    1) available to all mutual friends
    2) available to certain group of mutual friends

The entries of the second type can not be read via RSS, even after authentication. 
Only through a web interface. 

This is a serious problem that I do not know how to solve. If you have any ideas 
about this, contact me.
